# FreeProspectResearchResources

## Intro

Fundraising research is a niche field, with professionals working at non-profits, hospitals, universities, and private institutions. There are many "jack-of-all-trades" analyst positions where you may not have access to premium vendor tools. Prospect researchers often don't have a strong computer science background, and learn things on the fly - from basic Excel formulas to light scripting. Rarely do they venture into the dark waters of devops, but they should! My main goal in creating / curating these resources is to become a more technically proficient analyst, who can build and maintain tools just as well as using them.

I've also created this repository as a sandbox for collecting and developing open-source prospect research tools made by others - to benefit my peers at [Utah Apra](https://aprautah.wildapricot.org/), [National Apra](https://www.aprahome.org/), and beyond. 

I think that the worlds of OSINT, investigative journalism, applied micro-economics, data science, and machine learning can do much to upgrade current prospect research efforts - which will ultimately help institutions as they campaign to raise money for worthy causes.

## Current project ideas

* [Synthetic prospect research dataset generator](https://github.com/analyst-greg/FreeProspectResearchResources/wiki/Prospect-Research-Synthetic-Data): to be used in technical interviews, testing out vendor products or AI, for training purposes, and training models.
* Salary and compensation tool that utilizes public APIs, but also might be interesting to toy with a "disposable income" report generator based on job title, area code, industry, etc - since there is research on sub-sectors of the population and their spending habits
* Age-based "philanthropic likelihood" and other sociological research incorporated into a report generator, so you could put in the details of a prospect, and it could give you a summary of what their generational cohort tends to do (useful for larger lists / strategic planning, adding context: GenZ is NOT GenX, but that distinction is not always represented in Prospect Research reports and could add some color to boring profiles
* Local LLM built entirely for custom proofing / writing profiles so that you can include institutional style conventions, but also an application that exports them to Word and PDF (I know there are already many tools out there that do this, but I'm having trouble finding ones that let me customize the way that's needed for style guides that are boutique vs. something like grammarly)
* Excel "power user" tools - including basic data science stuff (e.g. templates / code that can look at a spreadsheet and create a profile based on column names and data, not pulling from CRM - useful for proactive research)
* Curating datasets for Utah institutions scraped from the internet, for educational purposes (e.g. awards lists)
* Combine multiple tools into an AI Prospect Research agent, given how agentic AI and research has gained some ground
