# FreeProspectResearchResources

## Intro

Fundraising research is a niche field, with professionals working at non-profits, hospitals, universities, and private institutions. There are many "jack-of-all-trades" analyst positions where you may not have access to premium vendor tools. Prospect researchers often don't have a strong computer science background, and learn things on the fly - from basic Excel formulas to light scripting. Rarely do they venture into the dark waters of devops, but they should! My main goal in creating / curating these resources is to become a more technically proficient analyst, who can build and maintain tools just as well as using them.

I've also created this repository as a sandbox for collecting and developing open-source prospect research tools made by others - to benefit my peers at [Utah Apra](https://aprautah.wildapricot.org/), [National Apra](https://www.aprahome.org/), and beyond. 

I think that the worlds of OSINT, investigative journalism, applied micro-economics, data science, and machine learning can do much to upgrade current prospect research efforts - which will ultimately help institutions as they campaign to raise money for worthy causes.
